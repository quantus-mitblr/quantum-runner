### Do you have what it takes to save the universe?  

We came this close to colonising the entire universe. And then, we ruined everything just like we ruined our Home Planet 0.1, the Earth.  

Now, we need your help.  

There is a way to save the entire universe before it collapses on itself into a void, and that knowledge must reach the right hands without getting destroyed! You're in-charge of carrying the qubit that carries vital data for the operation to the other end of the universe.  

Can you do it?

## How To Play:  

1. Use the arrow keys to make the qubit go left, right, up and down.  
2. Press 'K' to alternate between wave and particle states.  
3. Avoid lasers and walls.  
4. If there's an observer (eye) in front of a double-slit wall (the white one) remain a particle.  
5. Otherwise, press K to become a wave!
